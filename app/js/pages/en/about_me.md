My name's Maksim Babenko. I'm 23 years old and I major in WEB-developing.
My general experience in WEB-developing is 5 years.
I worked at Hotger corp PHP-programmers

I was involved in projects such as:

I keep working on my potential and try to learn something new. I am ready to learn and explore unfamiliar things for myself.
